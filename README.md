# 🌿 Healing Dancescapes  
*A responsive, accessible multi-page website designed for a dance meditation instructor.*

Healing Dancescapes is a front-end project focused on clean UI, consistent design, and a calm user experience.  
The site includes multiple pages—Home, About, Contact, Gallery, and FAQ—styled with a unified visual system and enhanced through interactive JavaScript.

This project reflects my attention to detail, accessibility awareness, and growing front-end development skills.
