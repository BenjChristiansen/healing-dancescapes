  <h3> What is a dance meditation session? </h3>
  <p>a meditation where your body gets to move instead of be still. This is a chance for your body to connect with your mind. The movement is not about looking a certain way, it is about letting your body move how it wants at its own pace. In this session you will release stress, feel grounded and reconnect with yourself.</p>
  <h3>How does dance help you heal?</h3>
    <p>Using movement as a medium of expression for what you cannot say, healing is a result. </p>
    <h3>Are you a therapist?</h3>
    <p>No.  I am not a substitute for, nor do I have credentialing as a doctor or therapist.  I cannot provide any medical advice or mental health support. If you are in crisis, please dial 988 to be connected with helpful resources.  I do have a Bachelors Degree in Dance Performance and Choreography from Weber State University and extensive experience with dance instruction. As part of my degree, I took supporting courses in kinesiology and psychology to explore the mind/body connection. </p>
    <h3>Do you offer other classes besides dance meditation?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Most of my experience is with ballet and modern dance but I am versitaile and have a love for teaching all dance genres. </p>
    <h3>Where are your in-person sessions?</h3>
    <p>Currently, I do not have access to a dance studio. Upon submitting a request, I collaborate with you to identify a space that works for both of us. </p>
    <h3>How do the virtual sessions work?</h3>
  <p>I offer my virtual sessions on Zoom. Upon submitting a request, I will provide you with a link, password and meeting ID.</p>
  <h3>What do I wear?</h3>
  <p> Comfortable, loose fitting clothing. Comfort is key.</p>
  <h3>What do I need to do to prepare before the session?</h3>
  <p> Drink plenty of water. Each person involved will need to sign a liability waiver for the session.</p>
  <h3>Do I need dance experience?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely not! My sessions are designed for all skillsets.</p>
  <h3>How many people can come to my group session? </h3>
    <p> If there is space, as many as can safely be accommodated are welcome.</p>
